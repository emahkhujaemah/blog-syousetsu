                <h3>Global Martial Arts :</h3>
                    <p>Fang Ping finally settled an issue after wasting half an hour of his life. He wasn’t dreaming nor acting —for God’s sake, if acting in a movie could restore his youth, then the film crew deserved a trip to heaven immediately!
                    </p>
                    <p>After verifying that he had reincarnated, Fang Ping felt a wave of panic before settling down and accepting the truth. <br>
                    
                        What was the truth? It was that he had indeed reincarnated into a younger version of himself, and since he was equipped with his knowledge of the future, he was going to seize the day and become the next-big-thing in the business world! He was going to be rich!</p>
                    <p>That was that, until his friend interrupted him. 
                    
                        “So are you signing up for the martial sciences exam?” <br>
                        
                        What? Was this a joke? Or had he been handed the wrong script? Was this even the right universe? What was martial sciences? Why did the exam cost 10 thousand yuan to sign up? Loaded with questions, Fang Ping will soon realize that he might not have struck the jackpot as he had initially thought…</p>

            <h3>The reincarnation of the Strongest Onmyoji ~These Monsters are Too Weak Compared to My Youkai~</h3>
            <p>Haruyoshi, the strongest onmyoji was on the verge of death after the betrayal of his companions. Hoping to be happy in the next life, he tried the secret technique of reincarnation and was sent to a different world! Born into a family of magicians, the magic he failed to inherit was nothing compared to his previous skills as an onmyoji. “Who needs magic? I’ll survive in this world with my old techniques!”</p>

                <p>Existing all over the world sleeps treasure tools with special powers.

                    Riches, Prestige, and finally Power.
                    
                    Chasing glory, an era where Treasure Hunters rampage through Treasure Shrines without regard for danger.
                    
                    Together with his childhood friends, Cry shares the dream of becoming a hunter. On their first expedition he notices that out of the six of them, he is the only one without any talent.
                    
                    However, that was only the beginning of their adventures. <br>
                    
                    “It’s too unreasonable. I want to quit this dangerous job already. I’m gonna throw up. ” <br>
                    
                    “Ok, got it. In other words we should get strong enough to cover your part too. Nice handicap.” <br>
                    
                    “Don’t worry Cry-chan. We’ll make sure to protect you.” <br>
                    
                    “Ah, stop. If you step there you’ll disappear without even leaving dust behind. Take care, ok leader?” <br>
                    
                    Protected by his childhood friends that are too strong, relying on his juniors and other hunters – they aim at being heroes and obtaining treasure.
                    
                    Will Cry be able to quit being a hunter while still in one piece?</p>
